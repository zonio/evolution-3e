Evolution Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- fix update acl eee_account_calendar_acl_set_shared()
- check for cross-subscription in evolution (two EAccounts both with 3e support,
  one is subscribing from other)
- subscribe: too many users handling
- documentation update

EDS Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~
- adding already existsing timezones produces error (update or not add)
- sometimes objects are added without adding tz first (if something changed on
  the server - tz was removed because of DB data reload)
- incremental sync does not work well (redesign using sequence ids?)
- automatic offline mode detection
- mark calendar offline feature: "offline" = "0" / "1" (e_source_set_property())
  by special plugin, make backend/gui use this
- recurrent events
- attachments
- send/receive messages through backend
- document what's missing and what needs to be done

Evolution/EDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- new meeting dialog sometimes freezes the whole evolution (see bugzilla/2.12.0?)
- don't add groups that does not represent owned accounts to the list in
  calendar/gui/dialogs/calendar-setup.c:432
