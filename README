Build Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed instructions can be found at http://wiki.zonio.net/.

3e calendar plugin requires a few small patches to evolution and
evolution-data-server (EDS). These will be integrated upstream in the future. As
of now you still need to rebuild Evolution and EDS with patches from patches/
directory.

Get and build libxr-0.9.94 or newer.

Build and install 3e plugin itself:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install


Quick Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions assume you have 'you@your-domain.net' e-mail account in
evolution.

1) Setup DNS

  Setup DNS TXT records for the domain of your email account. If you just want to
  try 3e without changing DNS TXT records for your domain globaly, you can setup
  dnsmasq(8) to act as DNS cache and supply TXT records for your domain.

  Add this line to your /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

    txt-record=your-domain.net,eee server=localhost:4444

2) Get 3e server

  Get 3e server from https://3e.zonio.net/releases/3e-server/.

  Edit the 3e server config file /etc/3e/server.conf:

    listen = *:4444
	threads = 10
	user = nobody
    group = nobody
	daemonize = 1
    pidfile = /var/run/3e-server.pid
    certificate = /etc/3e/server.pem

  Run the server using following command:

    /etc/init.d/3e-server start

3) Create your user account on the server

  You can do this using 3e command line client.

  Run 3e-client:

    3e-client -u root -p qwe

  Type in the following commands:

    create_user 'you@your-domain.net' 'qwe'
    modify_user 'you@your-domain.net' realname 'Your Name'
    create_calendar 'you@your-domain.net:personal'
    modify_calendar ''you@your-domain.net:personal' title 'Personal'
    modify_calendar 'you@your-domain.net:personal' color 'aabcbc'
    exit

4) Start Evolution

  You should be now able to see your 'Personal' calendar in a calendar list.
