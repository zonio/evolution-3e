@defgroup eds_cal EDS Calendar Information API

These functions are used to get infromation about calendar. Following
information are supplied: 
@li online/offline status (turns off all network access by disabling e_cal_backend_3e_open_connection())
@li whether immediate sync after cache modification is required (people with slow network will appreciate this feature)
@li calspec, calname, owner, perm (accessible from _ECalBackend3ePrivate)
@li etc.

All you need to do is to call e_cal_backend_3e_calendar_info_load() in
e_cal_backend_3e_open().

@defgroup eds_conn EDS Server Connection API

In order to be able to open and close connections you must first call
e_cal_backend_3e_setup_connection(). This function will setup connection
variables like username, password, server_uri, etc. Never modify these variables
from oustide of this API!

Lock is held from e_cal_backend_3e_open_connection() to
e_cal_backend_3e_close_connection(), so that 'connect -> work -> disconnect'
sequences that run in multiple threads are serialized.

@defgroup eds_sync EDS Cache Synchronization API

EDS backend methods manipulate the cache using wrapped e_cal_backend_cache_*()
methods. These methods update X-EEE-CACHE-STATE property to keep track the
changes that have been done.

EDS backend methods may then call e_cal_backend_3e_do_immediate_sync() to
write changes to the server whenever necessary.

The cache is protected by RW lock.

@defgroup eds_attach EDS Attachments API

Methods for uploading/downloading and keeping track of attachments.

@defgroup eds_misc EDS Misc API

Various functions to support iCal component manipulation.

@defgroup eds_back EDS Backend

EDS backend methods.
